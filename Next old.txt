Ride:<Source & distination>

status of the ride (completed / inservice / requested / etc...)

decided by the driver

For the start ride, the source could be anywhere, and the destination is Gate 3/4.

For the end ride, the source is Gate 3/4, and the destination is anywhere.

There are time constraints to reserve any trip (Customers who need a ride at 7:30 must reserve their seat before 10:00 pm the previous day. Customers who need a ride from campus at 5:30 pm must reserve their seat before 1:00 pm on the same day).

Cost Itâ€™s flexible. You could either set a fixed cost or calculate it based on the distance.If 
calculated based on the distance between the source and destination, a map API 
might be needed.
You might also add functionality for the driver to set the cost himself.
